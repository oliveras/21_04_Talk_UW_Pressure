        \item[] Can we go to higher order?  What is the price that we have to pay?
        \vfill

        \item[] Can we implement a feedback mechanism to drive the error to zero? 
        \begin{itemize}

            \item[] Data Assimilation via Titi's work
        \end{itemize}
        \vfill

        \item[] Can this be paired with the multiple-scales ideas outlined in my previous talk for model-regime prediction?
